# SAP HANA Driver for SQLTools
A Visual Studio Code extension which extends SQLTools extension, with a driver to work with SAP HANA Database. It supports Tables and Views and running queries on a SAP HANA Database.

## Creating connection schema for the assistant

We are using `@rjsf/core` to render the forms, so in order to add you driver to the connection assistant,
edit `connection.schema.json` and `ui.schema.json`.

See https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for more instructions.
